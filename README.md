# EmptyProject
An empty project for CSPB2270 final projects


<hr>

### What is the purpose of this project?
The purpose of the project is to give you a chance to find a new (to you) data structure and do something interesting with it. 
There are several ways to go about doing this. You might begin to solve some problem and use that to guide a decision on which data structure is (in your view) the most appropriate. Another way to do it is to find an interesting data structure that you'd like to explore more and invent a use for it. Either way is OK. 

You must find a data structure for your project which is *different than the ones we have used in programming assignments*. There are many different extensions for the data structures covered in the course as well as many different data structures that we have not investigated in the course.

### How much time will it take?
You should plan to allocate about 30 hours between now and the end of the semester to building your project around the data structure that you have selected.

### How will the project be evaluated?
The proposal grade accounts for 30% of your overall project score. You should write at most a Two Page description of your proposal.  You can write it in a word processor and add a PDF version to your project repository or you can add a markdown file to your project repository and write the proposal in the markdown language you see here. 

**Your proposal is going to be graded by your fellow students.**

The proposal grading will take the following into consideration:
* is it clearly and coherently stating the problem that you're attempting to solve
* have you defended your choice of data structure (e.g. why did you X and not use Y or Z instead?)
* have you provided a description of your plan for implementing different parts of the code
   * How many functions do you think your data structure should have? 
   * What do each of the functions accomplish?
   * How are you planning to implement each function? (what is the basic algorithm?)
   * Do you need recursive functions?
   *  . . .
* have you provided a definition of what 'done' looks like for the project. 
   * you might propose writing unit-tests similar to class homework. If you do then you should discuss how your tests are going to look.
   * what test cases should the project be able to handle when project is completed?

### Interview Grading
You don't need to write anything after the project is done, we are going to grade your project over an interview grading meeting. 
Interview grading schedules are going to be out during finals week.
